The solution involves increasing the specificity of the selector `.container .specific`.  This can be achieved by adding another class to the element or making the selector more precise by using the specific class selector again. 

```css
.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container div.specific {
  color: green;
}

.container .specific {
  color: purple; /* This selector is less specific */
}

/* Solution:  Increase Specificity */
.container .specific.extra {
  color: purple;
}

/* Or use more specific selectors like */
.container .specific {
 color: purple; /* Now works as intended */
}
```

By adjusting the CSS selectors, the specificity is correctly managed, leading to the expected behavior.
